# Welcome to the UC Berkeley SEP Site

Some text

### For Developers

This website is built using `React`, bootstrapped with `Create-React-App`.

In order to start your development server, run:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

#### Deployment

Deployment is NO LONGER COMPLICATED. Deployment is through AWS Amplify on David W.'s personal AWS, so it should automatically refresh with every new commit :). Please do not spam commits as you might overcharge the AWS. Go through the PR System.

#### Continued work

1. Purchase multiple domains and redirect to main `berkeleysep.com` page.
2. Optimize images and potentially rework the front page animation.
3. Family Tree
4. Add Animations
