# Welcome to the UC Berkeley SEP Site

Some text

### For Developers

This website is built using `React`, bootstrapped with `Create-React-App`.

In order to start your development server, run:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

#### Deployment

Deployment is complicated, but it shouldn't be with these steps:

1. Make your changes
2. Commit and push (make sure to merge onto `main` branch)
3. Run while on `main` branch:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

If all goes well, `www.berkeleysep.com` should have the updated changes in a few minutes.


#### Continued work

1. There may be concerns with hosting on Github pages in the future.
2. Purchase multiple domains and redirect to main `berkeleysep.com` page.
3. Optimize images and potentially rework the front page animation.
